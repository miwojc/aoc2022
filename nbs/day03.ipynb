    "Day 3 is different. The solutions presented here are generated by AI - [chatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). All what i did was to 1:1 copy and paste the full instruction from advent of code webiste to chatGPT with added sentence `write computer program in python ...` The result is working python code that generates the right answer! I will not black, pylint or mypy the chatGPT generated code. It's 1:1 what was generated, except of adding the rest of missing return statment: from ```return sum_of_pri``` to ```return sum_of_priorities```. That is a very minor detail, but of course it's needed for the function to work!"
