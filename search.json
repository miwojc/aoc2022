    "text": "Santa’s reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.\nTo supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.\nCollect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!\nThe jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves’ expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\nThe Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they’ve brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf’s inventory (if any) by a blank line.\nFor example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items’ Calories and end up with the following list:\n1000\n2000\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n6000\n\n7000\n8000\n9000\n\n10000\nThis list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n\nThe first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.\nThe second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.\nThe third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.\nThe fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.\nThe fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.\n\nIn case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they’d like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).\nFind the Elf carrying the most Calories.

That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.\nIn the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories).

    "text": "You can hear birds chirping and raindrops hitting leaves as the expedition proceeds. Occasionally, you can even hear much louder sounds in the distance; how big do the animals get out here, anyway?\nThe device the Elves gave you has problems with more than just its communication system. You try to run a system update:\n$ system-update –please –pretty-please-with-sugar-on-top Error: No space left on device\nPerhaps you can delete some files to make space for the update?\nYou browse around the filesystem to assess the situation and save the resulting terminal output (your puzzle input). For example:\n$ cd /\n$ ls\ndir a\n14848514 b.txt\n8504156 c.dat\ndir d\n$ cd a\n$ ls\ndir e\n29116 f\n2557 g\n62596 h.lst\n$ cd e\n$ ls\n584 i\n$ cd ..\n$ cd ..\n$ cd d\n$ ls\n4060174 j\n8033020 d.log\n5626152 d.ext\n7214296 k\nThe filesystem consists of a tree of files (plain data) and directories (which can contain other directories or files). The outermost directory is called /. You can navigate around the filesystem, moving into or out of directories and listing the contents of the directory you’re currently in.\nWithin the terminal output, lines that begin with $ are commands you executed, very much like some modern computers:\n\ncd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:\ncd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory.\ncd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.\ncd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /.\nls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:\n123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named abc with size 123.\ndir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz.\n\nGiven the commands and output in the example above, you can determine that the filesystem looks visually like this:\n- / (dir)\n  - a (dir)\n    - e (dir)\n      - i (file, size=584)\n    - f (file, size=29116)\n    - g (file, size=2557)\n    - h.lst (file, size=62596)\n  - b.txt (file, size=14848514)\n  - c.dat (file, size=8504156)\n  - d (dir)\n    - j (file, size=4060174)\n    - d.log (file, size=8033020)\n    - d.ext (file, size=5626152)\n    - k (file, size=7214296)\nHere, there are four directories: / (the outermost directory), a and d (which are in /), and e (which is in a). These directories also contain files of various sizes.\nSince the disk is full, your first step should probably be to find directories that are good candidates for deletion. To do this, you need to determine the total size of each directory. The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of the files it contains, directly or indirectly. (Directories themselves do not count as having any intrinsic size.)\nThe total sizes of the directories above can be found as follows:\n\nThe total size of directory e is 584 because it contains a single file i of size 584 and no other directories.\nThe directory a has total size 94853 because it contains files f (size 29116), g (size 2557), and h.lst (size 62596), plus file i indirectly (a contains e which contains i).\nDirectory d has total size 24933642.\nAs the outermost directory, / contains every file. Its total size is 48381165, the sum of the size of every file.\n\nTo begin, find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000, then calculate the sum of their total sizes. In the example above, these directories are a and e; the sum of their total sizes is 95437 (94853 + 584). (As in this example, this process can count files more than once!)\nFind all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

    "text": "Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.\nHowever, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they’ve noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).\nFor example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:\n2-4,6-8\n2-3,4-5\n5-7,7-9\n2-8,3-7\n6-6,4-6\n2-6,4-8\nFor the first few pairs, this list means:\n\nWithin the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).\nThe Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.\nThe Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.\n\nThis example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:\n.234.....  2-4\n.....678.  6-8\n\n.23......  2-3\n...45....  4-5\n\n....567..  5-7\n......789  7-9\n\n.2345678.  2-8\n..34567..  3-7\n\n.....6...  6-6\n...456...  4-6\n\n.23456...  2-6\n...45678.  4-8\nSome of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration.

To decide whose tent gets to be closest to the snack storage, a giant Rock Paper Scissors tournament is already in progress.\nRock Paper Scissors is a game between two players. Each game contains many rounds; in each round, the players each simultaneously choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using a hand shape. Then, a winner for that round is selected: Rock defeats Scissors, Scissors defeats Paper, and Paper defeats Rock. If both players choose the same shape, the round instead ends in a draw.\nAppreciative of your help yesterday, one Elf gives you an encrypted strategy guide (your puzzle input) that they say will be sure to help you win. “The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. The second column–” Suddenly, the Elf is called away to help with someone’s tent.\nThe second column, you reason, must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Winning every time would be suspicious, so the responses must have been carefully chosen.\nThe winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).\nSince you can’t be sure if the Elf is trying to help you or trick you, you should calculate the score you would get if you were to follow the strategy guide.\nFor example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:\nA Y\nB X\nC Z\nThis strategy guide predicts and recommends the following:\n\nIn the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won).\nIn the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X).

    "text": "The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and begin to make your way toward the star fruit grove.\nAs you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld device. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to set up right now is the communication system.\nHowever, because he’s heard you have significant experience dealing with signal-based systems, he convinced the other Elves that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device - surely you’ll have no problem fixing it.\nAs if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.\nTo be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to lock on to their signal. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device receives one at a time.\nTo fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that detects a start-of-packet marker in the datastream. In the protocol being used by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of four characters that are all different.\nThe device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input); your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of the first such four-character marker.\nFor example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:\nmjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb\nAfter the first three characters (mjq) have been received, there haven’t been enough characters received yet to find the marker.

Unfortunately, that Elf didn’t quite follow the packing instructions, and so a few items now need to be rearranged.\nEach rucksack has two large compartments. All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly one of the two compartments. The Elf that did the packing failed to follow this rule for exactly one item type per rucksack.\nThe Elves have made a list of all of the items currently in each rucksack (your puzzle input), but they need your help finding the errors. Every item type is identified by a single lowercase or uppercase letter (that is, a and A refer to different types of items).\nThe list of items for each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line. A given rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments, so the first half of the characters represent items in the first compartment, while the second half of the characters represent items in the second compartment.\nFor example, suppose you have the following list of contents from six rucksacks:\nvJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp\njqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL\nPmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg\nwMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn\nttgJtRGJQctTZtZT\nCrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw\n\nThe first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp.

Every Elf carries a badge that identifies their group. For efficiency, within each group of three Elves, the badge is the only item type carried by all three Elves. That is, if a group’s badge is item type B, then all three Elves will have item type B somewhere in their rucksack, and at most two of the Elves will be carrying any other item type.\nThe problem is that someone forgot to put this year’s updated authenticity sticker on the badges. All of the badges need to be pulled out of the rucksacks so the new authenticity stickers can be attached.\nAdditionally, nobody wrote down which item type corresponds to each group’s badges. The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.\nEvery set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type.

    "text": "The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.\nThe ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.\nThe Elves don’t want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.\nThey do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:\n    [D]    \n[N] [C]    \n[Z] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3 \n\nmove 1 from 2 to 1  \nmove 3 from 1 to 3  \nmove 2 from 2 to 1  \nmove 1 from 1 to 2  \nIn this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.\nThen, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:\n[D]        \n[N] [C]    \n[Z] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3 \nIn the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:\n        [Z]\n        [N]\n    [C] [D]\n    [M] [P]\n 1   2   3\nThen, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1.
